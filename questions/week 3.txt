At block scope only identifiers decalted with extern have linkage. others have no linkage and therefor will give a compilation error if declared multiple times.

4.
The action that is performed is called type aliasing and it's meaningless because of ANSI C aliasing rules which prohibits type aliasing to help compilers optimze C code. However there are some exceptions to this called: corresponding integer types which allows for void/char or integers with different sign.

It's stored as 1000 xx....xx 0101 which is is a very large number if unsigned.
