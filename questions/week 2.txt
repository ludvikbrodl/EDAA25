+, -. -- ++

4.
The temp pointer can be pointing to the old location of the array, the reallocated memory might be somewhere entirely different.

5.
realloc might return null, in which case the pointer is lost making free(p) impossible.

6.
list->succ

7.
sizeof "C11" is 4 because the endstring byte needs to be stored
strlen returns the number of chars = 3;
